once upon a time there lived two siblings in an abandoned village named Hansel and Gratel. They both belonged to a poor family and faced a lot of struggles. The family was starving since days and did not have a penny to afford food. One night the father and step-mother of both children decided to take a decision which was forced by extreme hunger. What they did not know was that the decision would completely change their lives.
Then they learn Java, a powerful programming language that completely changed their lives. Now they are sitting in the office and programming a Red-Black tree.
Hansel and Gretel missed their simpler life before coding and longed to return to the forest.  Packing up their laptops, they set off to the witches house.
The witch taught them Python. Now they never use Java. Hansel and Gretel love the witch for teaching them a better language. The End.
